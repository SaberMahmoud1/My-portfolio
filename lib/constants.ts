  description:
    'An end-to-end RTL lane detection system for real-time road perception in autonomous vehicles. The system operates on streaming image data row-by-row, processing it through RGB-to-grayscale conversion, noise reduction using an averaging filter, Sobel edge detection, and custom decision logic to identify lane count, boundaries, and current lane position. Designed entirely in Verilog, achieving ultra-low latency. The system was synthesized and deployed on both ZCU102 and PYNQ-Z2 boards. Verification was conducted using QuestaSim, and synthesis used Vivado. The project was mentored by the Electronic Research Institute (ERI).',
