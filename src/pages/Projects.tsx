  title: 'FPGA-Based Lane Detection System',
  description:
    'An end-to-end RTL lane detection system for real-time road perception in autonomous vehicles. The system operates on streaming image data row-by-row, processing it through RGB-to-grayscale conversion, noise reduction using an averaging filter, Sobel edge detection, and custom decision logic to identify lane count, boundaries, and current lane position. Designed entirely in Verilog, achieving ultra-low latency. The system was synthesized and deployed on both ZCU102 and PYNQ-Z2 boards. Verification was conducted using QuestaSim, and synthesis used Vivado. The project was mentored by the Electronic Research Institute (ERI).',

  title: 'AXI4 DMA Controller',
  description:
    'A custom-designed Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller that enables high-performance data transfers between memory regions or peripherals and memory over the AXI4 interface, without CPU intervention. The controller supports burst transactions, configurable transfer sizes, and includes a priority arbitration mechanism for optimized throughput. The design was implemented in SystemVerilog and verified using direct testbench. It followed a complete ASIC design flow, with synthesis performed to ensure resource efficiency, timing closure, and silicon readiness. The project was mentored by Si-Vision, providing professional guidance on RTL design and verification.',
